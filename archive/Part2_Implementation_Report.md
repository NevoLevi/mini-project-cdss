### Algorithm Implementation Details

#### Enhanced Interval Calculation Algorithm
```python

    # 1. Get patient measurements for all relevant parameters
    # 2. For each measurement timestamp:
    #    - Calculate validity window (Before-Good + After-Good)
    #    - Determine medical state using classification logic
    #    - If matches target state, add to interval candidates
    # 3. For multi-parameter states (Hematological, Systemic):
    #    - Find intersection of all parameter validity periods
    #    - Apply AND/OR logic as appropriate
    # 4. Merge overlapping intervals intelligently
    # 5. Return sorted, consolidated intervals with durations
```

#### MAXIMAL OR Systemic Toxicity Algorithm (4:1)
```python
def calculate_systemic_toxicity_grade(fever, chills, skin, allergic):
    # For MAXIMAL OR: Take the highest grade from any parameter
    # 1. Calculate grade for each parameter independently
    # 2. Apply classification rules (Grade I-IV)
    # 3. Return maximum grade (most severe condition)
    # 4. Handle special case: Grade IV fever = 40.0+ Celsius (FIXED)
